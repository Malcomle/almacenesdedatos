# User Interface Tools and Prototyping Techniques

Tools and prototyping accelerate development by allowing early user feedback and iterative design improvements.

---

## 1. Types of Tools for UI Development

### Motivation
- Tools facilitate requirements, design, prototyping, implementation, and testing.

### Examples by Stage
- **Requirements**: Visual Paradigm, Rational Doors, Jira.  
- **Design**: diagrams.net, Visual Paradigm, Eclipse Papyrus.  
- **Prototyping**: Adobe Xd, Figma, Sketch, InVision.  
- **Implementation**: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, WebStorm.  
- **Testing**: Selenium, Cucumber, Jasmine.  
- **Evaluation**: UserTesting, Google Forms.

## 2. Prototyping Techniques

- **Vertical Prototypes**: Deep functionality in a few features.  
- **Horizontal Prototypes**: Broad coverage of many features with limited depth.

### Fidelity Levels
- **Low-Fidelity**: Quick, rough (paper sketches).  
- **High-Fidelity**: Detailed digital mockups, closer to final UI.

## 3. Techniques in Detail

- **Sketches**: Rough designs in seconds.  
- **Storyboards**: Sequential images showing user tasks.  
- **Paper Prototypes**: Lightweight, easy to adapt.  
- **Digital Mockups**: Higher detail, often semi-functional.  
- **Navigational Storyboards**: Visual map of all possible interface paths.  
- **Video Prototypes**: Simulated system behaviors using video.  
- **Scenarios**: Narrative use cases describing real user workflows.  
- **Software Prototypes**: Interactive coded prototypes with partial functionality.

## 4. Comparison of Prototyping Tools

- **Adobe Xd**: Chosen for this course (documentation, multi-language support).
- **Others**: Figma, Sketch, InVision, Pencil, etc.

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prototyping**          | Creating early models of an interface to gather user feedback                                    |
| **Low-Fidelity Prototype** | Quick, minimal representation (often paper-based) for exploring ideas                           |
| **High-Fidelity Prototype** | Detailed, closely resembling the final product (digital, clickable mockups)                   |
| **Navigational Storyboard** | Visualizes user paths across different screens or states                                      |
| **Scenario**             | A story illustrating how a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal                         |
