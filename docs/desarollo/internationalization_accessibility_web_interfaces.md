# Internationalization and Accessibility in Web Interfaces

Expanding on how to adapt web systems to different languages, cultures, and accessibility needs.

---

## 1. Introduction to Internationalization

- Goes beyond translation—considers alphabets, encoding, cultural norms.  
- Benefits: Larger market reach, maintainable code, consistent product.

---

## 2. Design Considerations for Internationalization

- **Culture**: Avoid political/religious symbols.  
- **Color**: Meanings vary by region (white for mourning in some countries).  
- **Calendars**: Different systems (Gregorian, Chinese, Hebrew).  
- **Currency**: Varying symbols and formats.  
- **Writing Systems**: Right-to-left vs. left-to-right, text expansion needs.

---

## 3. Writing Systems and Encoding

- **ASCII vs. Unicode**: Unicode supports multiple scripts and directions.  
- Consider text expansion for languages that require more space.

---

## 4. Practical Resources

- **W3C i18n**: Guides on supporting multiple languages.  
- **Unicode Consortium**: Official standard definitions.
