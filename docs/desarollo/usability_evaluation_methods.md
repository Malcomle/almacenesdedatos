# Usability Evaluation Methods for User Interfaces

Evaluating usability throughout development ensures the product meets real user needs.

---

## 1. Evaluating Usability

- **Motivation**: Confirm design quality before final release.  
- **Core Principles**: User-centered, context-aware, user satisfaction, user-determined usability.

---

## 2. Types of Evaluation Methods

### 1. Inspection Methods
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Experts compare UI against usability principles.  
- **Cognitive Walkthrough**: Experts simulate user tasks, focusing on learnability.  
- **Standards Inspection**: Checking compliance with ISO or corporate standards.

### 2. Inquiry Methods
- **Field Observation**: Observers watch users in real contexts.  
- **Focus Groups**: Group discussions for collective insights.  
- **Interviews**: One-on-one structured or semi-structured sessions.  
- **Questionnaires**: Collecting user feedback at various stages.  
- **Logging**: Automated tracking of user actions in production environments.

### 3. Testing Methods
- **Performance Measurement**: Time on tasks, error rates, help usage.  
- **Thinking Aloud**: Users vocalize thoughts while performing tasks.  
- **Constructive Interaction**: Pair-based testing (two users collaborating).  
- **Wizard of Oz**: An evaluator simulates system responses for unbuilt features.  
- **Retrospective Testing**: Users review recordings of their own interactions.
