# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Devices, and Interaction Styles

This section covers the fundamentals of HCI, explaining how users and computers interact through various devices and interface types.

## 1. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

### Definition
- HCI (or Interacci√≥n Persona-Ordenador) focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating computer systems for human use.

### Purpose of HCI
- Continuously improve interactive computer systems by considering user needs, context of use, and usability.

### Importance of HCI
- UI and interaction design heavily influence software success.  
- Modern techniques and tools reduce development time for interfaces.

## 2. Key Definitions

- **User**: The person interacting with the computer system.  
- **Interaction**: Exchanges of input actions and system feedback.  
- **Interface**: The part of the system the user interacts with (physically and cognitively).

**Main Components of an Interactive System**:
1. User  
2. Input/Output Subsystem  
3. Processing Subsystem

## 3. Devices

### Physical Devices
- **Keyboard**, **Screen**, **Pointing Devices**, **Voice Devices**, **Eye-Tracking Devices**.

### Logical Devices
- Abstract elements that provide specific data types (Pointer, Text Input, Choice Input, etc.).
- **Basic Interaction Tasks (BIT)**: Locator, Quantity, Text, Choice, Drag.

### Matching Devices
- Physical devices vs. logical devices choice depends on:
  - **User Characteristics** (capabilities, preferences).  
  - **Interaction Environment** (collaborative, mobile, etc.).

## 4. Interaction Styles

- **Command-Line Interface**: Text-based commands.
- **Menu & Navigation**: Hierarchical menus for user actions.
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Voice, gestures, etc.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Dragging, dropping, and manipulating on-screen objects.
- **Assisted Interaction**: Agents or wizards guiding the user.
- **Common in Web**: Menu & navigation-based style.

| **HCI**          | Human-Computer Interaction; study of how people interact with computer systems                        |
| **Physical Device** | A tangible piece of hardware used for interaction (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen)                   |
| **Logical Device**  | An abstraction that provides a specific type of data to the system (pointer, text, etc.)           |
| **Interaction Style** | The manner in which users and systems communicate (command line, GUI, voice, etc.)              |
| **BIT (Basic Interaction Task)** | A minimal interaction unit (locator, quantity, choice, etc.)                          |
