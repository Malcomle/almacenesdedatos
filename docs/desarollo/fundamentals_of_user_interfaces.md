# Fundamentals of User Interfaces

This section introduces the importance of user interface (UI) design and explains how human factors influence usability and user experience.

## 1. Understanding the User

### Motivation
Traditionally, UI design was overlooked, but research has shown that poor interfaces frustrate users. Thus, understanding human factors is crucial to improving design and usability.

### Cognitive Psychology
Users are at the core of digital system interactions. Cognitive psychology helps us analyze how users perceive and process information. Key insights:
- **Human Processing Model**:  
  1. **Input Devices** (Vision, Hearing, Touch)  
  2. **Central Unit** (Attention, Working Memory, Long-Term Memory)  
  3. **Output Devices** (Limbs, Fingers, Voice)

#### Sensory Perception
- **Visual Perception**: Most critical in UI design (color, brightness, size, depth).  
- **Auditory Perception**: Important for feedback and accessibility.  
- **Tactile Perception**: Essential for touch-based interfaces.

#### Visual Perception
- Color usage is vital (avoid red-on-blue, ensure high contrast).  
- Some users have color vision deficiencies; color alone shouldn’t convey critical info.

#### Attention and Perception
- Attention filters information. Overloaded interfaces can hinder focus.  
- Studies show users ignore less relevant areas (e.g., banner blindness).

#### Perception and Knowledge
- Icons leverage real-world associations. They must be clear, familiar, and unambiguous.

#### Affordances
- Affordance: The perceived function of an object (e.g., a button appears “pressable”).

#### Text Perception
- Readability depends on font size (optimal 9–12pt) and line length (6–13 cm).
