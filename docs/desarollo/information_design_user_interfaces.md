# Information Design in User Interfaces

Information design establishes a consistent “style” across an application, focusing on visual, auditory, and tactile elements.

---

## 1. Importance of Information Design

- Covers visual and interactive facets for all application functionalities.  
- Goes beyond graphic design—usability must be considered.

---

## 2. Key Elements of Information Design

1. **Metaphors**: Familiar concepts to aid user understanding.  
2. **Graphic Design Aspects**: Images, light, color, Gestalt principles.  
3. **Standards & Style Guides**: General or corporate guidelines.  
4. **Feedback & Error Management**: Informing users of system status and issues.

---

## 3. Metaphors

- **Example**: Scissors icon for “cut,” floppy disk for “save.”  
- Must be relevant, easy to interpret, and well-tested with users.

---

## 4. Image Elements

- **Point, Line, Shape**: Core building blocks in a UI.  
- **Color**: Must consider contrast, color blindness, and symbolic meanings.

---

## 5. Gestalt Principles

- **Proximity, Similarity, Closure, Continuity, Symmetry, Figure/Ground**.  
- Influence how users group and interpret elements.

---

## 6. Organization of Elements

- **Balance, Symmetry, Regularity, Alignment**.  
- **Gridding**: Maintaining structural consistency.

---

## 7. Style Guides & Standards

- **Commercial** (e.g., Material Design, Apple HIG) or **Corporate** (in-house).  
- **ISO/IEC 9126, ISO 9241**: General usability and ergonomic standards.

---

## 8. Feedback & Error Management

- **Feedback**: Visual, auditory, or tactile signals. Past/present/future focus.  
- **Error Management**: Avoid imperative or confusing messages; provide constructive guidance.
