# Requirements Analysis and User-Centered Design

Analyzing user and business needs is vital in creating effective, user-friendly interfaces.

---

## 1. Motivation for Requirements Analysis

- Software development starts with client needs.  
- Miscommunication can lead to delivering incorrect features.  
- Usability is a priority in UI developmentâ€”users must remain the focus.

---

## 2. Importance of Good Requirements Analysis

- Distinguish between stated needs and actual needs.  
- **Functional Requirements**: Core operations (e.g., search).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, compatibility, usability, etc.

---

## 3. Activities for Requirements Gathering

- **Ethnographic Analysis**: Observe users in their environment.  
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify all individuals involved.  
- **User Classification**: Group users by profiles and roles.  
- **User Stories**: Describe features from the user perspective.  
- **Contextual Task Analysis**: Examine user tasks to identify patterns.  
- **Physical & Conceptual Objects**: Recognize tangible and intangible items.  
- **Technological Platform Analysis**: Evaluate deployment environment.

---

## 4. User Stories

- Brief, user-focused descriptions of features.  
- Include title, description, acceptance criteria, and discussions.

---

## 5. Contextual Task Analysis

- Understand current tasks and workflows.  
- Uncover user goals and how they achieve them.

---

## 6. Identifying Physical & Conceptual Objects

- Physical: Documents, tools, etc.  
- Conceptual: Events, messages, etc.

---

## 7. Technological Platform Analysis

- Identify hardware/software constraints.  
- Align UI design with available tech resources.

---

## 8. Application Objectives

- Must be consistent, simplify user interactions, and ensure accessibility within minimal steps.

---

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Product Requirements**: Memory usage, response times.  
- **Organizational Requirements**: Company policies/standards.  
- **External Requirements**: Legal or interoperability factors.

### Usability Requirements (ISO Standards)
- **ISO 9241, ISO 13407, ISO 9126, ISO 25010**: International usability and quality guidelines.
