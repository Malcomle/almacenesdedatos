# Web Accessibility and Internationalization

Universal usability is a core aim in modern web design, ensuring all users—regardless of ability or location—can effectively use the interface.

## 1. Universal Design and Web Accessibility

### Motivation
- Humans vary greatly; interfaces should adapt to these differences.  
- The web is ideal for broad accessibility.

### W3C and Web Accessibility
- **W3C**: Develops standards (HTML, CSS, etc.) to reach the widest user base.  
- **WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative)**: Ensures web tech is accessible to people with disabilities.

### Aging Population
- More older adults with functional limitations require accessible digital services.  
- Government regulations encourage accessible design.

### Designing for Various Limitations
- Temporary limitations (driving, noisy environment) can mimic disability constraints.  
- Universal design principles (e.g., flexible use) help everyone.

## 2. Internationalization and Accessibility

- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Preparing a product for multiple languages/cultures.  
- **Localization (l10n)**: Customizing the product for one specific locale.

### Design Considerations
- Avoid language/cultural assumptions in code.  
- Color perception differs by culture.  
- Calendars, currency, writing direction vary worldwide.  
- Unicode allows for multiple scripts and symbols.

### Practical Tools
- **Vischeck**: Color visibility checker.  
- **W3C Accessibility Tools**: Comprehensive solutions for checking compliance.  
- **WebAIM Checklist**: Step-by-step conformance guide.
