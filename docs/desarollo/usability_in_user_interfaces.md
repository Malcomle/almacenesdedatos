# Usability in User Interfaces

Usability ensures a product can be used effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily by its intended users.

---

## 1. Definition of Usability

- **Usability**: The degree to which a product enables specific users to achieve their goals in a particular context effectively, efficiently, and with satisfaction.

### Key Principles
- **Learnability**, **Efficiency**, **Memorability**, **Error Management**, **Satisfaction**.

---

## 2. Common Usability Issues in Web Pages

- Buttons resembling labels.
- Confusing action zones.
- Similar or ambiguous controls.
- Hard-to-remember interactions.
- Missing or broken links (e.g., 404 errors).

---

## 3. Emphasis on Usability

- **Donald Norman**: If a simple door needs instructions, it’s poorly designed.  
- Usable software should minimize user frustration and cognitive load.

---

## 4. Misconceptions About Usability

- “Users just need more training”  
- “Usability is subjective and immeasurable”  
- “Knowing style guides is enough”  
- “Usability increases costs”

---

## 5. Usability Principles

- **Consistency**: Visual coherence across the interface.  
- **Familiarity**: Leverage prior user knowledge.  
- **Learnability**: Short learning curve.  
- **Flexibility**: Multiple interaction methods.  
- **Recoverability**: Easy error handling.  
- **Feedback**: System actively indicates status/actions.  
- **Simplicity**: Minimal clutter.  
- **Visibility**: Clear controls aligned with real-world expectations.  
- **Availability**: Objects accessible at the right time.  
- **Personalization**: Allows customization.

---

## 6. User-Centered Design

- Involve users throughout design.
- Observe users in their work environment.
- Use prototypes (storyboards, mockups) for early testing.

---

## 7. Usability’s Four Pillars

1. User-Centered  
2. Context Knowledge  
3. User Satisfaction  
4. User Evaluation

---

## 8. When to Consider Usability

- **Before the Project**: Understand target users and key features.  
- **During Development**: Conduct usability tests.  
- **After Release**: Gather user feedback for improvements.
