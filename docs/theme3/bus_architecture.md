# Data Warehouse Bus Architecture

Bus architecture is a framework popularized by Ralph Kimball that helps organizations build scalable and incremental data warehouse solutions. It emphasizes using standardized dimensions and facts across multiple data marts.

## Key Principles

1. **Reusable Dimensions**  
   - Dimensions such as Time, Product, or Customer can be shared across various subject areas.
2. **Conformed Dimensions**  
   - Dimensions follow consistent definitions and structures to enable cross-functional analysis.
3. **Incremental Development**  
   - New data marts can be added over time as the business grows or as new subject areas are identified.

## Advantages

- **Cross-Functional Analysis**: Conformed dimensions allow data from different areas (e.g., sales, inventory, finance) to be analyzed together.  
- **Consistency**: Standardized dimension definitions ensure uniformity in reporting metrics across departments.  
- **Scalability**: Organizations can add or modify data marts without overhauling the entire architecture.
