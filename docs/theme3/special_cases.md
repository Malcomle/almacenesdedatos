# Special Cases in Dimensional Modeling

While standard dimensional modeling addresses most scenarios, certain edge cases require additional techniques to handle complex data or unusual measurement methods.

---

## Degenerate Dimensions
- **Definition**: Dimensions that exist logically but have no descriptive attributesâ€”only an identifier (e.g., an order number).  
- **Use Case**: The key is kept in the fact table, but a separate dimension table is not needed.

---

## Factless Fact Tables
- **Definition**: Fact tables with no numeric measures, used to record the occurrence of events or conditions.  
- **Example**: Tracking which products are on promotion, even if zero units are sold.  
- **Benefit**: Helps analyze events that do not necessarily carry a numeric measurement but are still significant for business analysis.

## Handling Granularity Variations
- **Problem**: Facts captured at different granularities (e.g., daily vs. monthly).  
- **Solution**:  
  1. **Separate Fact Tables** for each granularity level.  
  2. **Consistent ETL Policies** to ensure data is aggregated or disaggregated appropriately.
