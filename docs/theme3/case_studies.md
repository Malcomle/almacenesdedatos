# Case Studies in Dimensional Design

Real-world examples provide insights into how dimensional modeling principles apply across various industries. Below are multiple scenarios that demonstrate the versatility of facts, dimensions, and hierarchies.

## Case 1: Inventory Analysis
- **Scenario**: Managing stock levels in a retail or warehouse context.  
- **Fact Table**: Inventory snapshots (daily or weekly).  
- **Dimensions**: Product, Store (or Warehouse), Time.  
- **Metrics**: Inventory level, restock frequency, safety stock threshold.

## Case 2: CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
- **Scenario**: Tracking customer interactions and transactions.  
- **Fact Table**: Recorded interactions (emails, calls, purchases).  
- **Dimensions**: Customer, Time, Location, Product Preferences.
