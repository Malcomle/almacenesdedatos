# Multidimensional Data Models

Multidimensional data models form the foundation of analytical systems (e.g., OLAP). They allow businesses to explore data across multiple axes (dimensions) simultaneously.

## Core Concepts

### Cubes
- **Definition**: A multi-axis data structure extending the concept of 2D spreadsheets to multiple dimensions.  
- **Hierarchies**: Within each dimension (e.g., Time), you can define levels (Year → Quarter → Month → Day).

### Facts and Measures
- **Facts**: Objects or events that an organization wishes to analyze (e.g., sales, inventory, transactions).  
- **Measures**: Numeric properties of facts (e.g., revenue, quantity, count) that are aggregated or analyzed.

### Dimensions
- **Definition**: Perspectives for analysis such as Time, Location, or Product.  
- **Roll-up & Drill-down**: Dimensions often include hierarchies enabling aggregated or detailed views of data.

**Example**  
A retailer may analyze sales by:
- **Time Dimension**: Year → Quarter → Month → Day  
- **Product Dimension**: Category → Subcategory → Item  
- **Geography Dimension**: Country → Region → City

## Why Use Multidimensional Models?
- **Efficient Aggregation**: Pre-summarized data in cubes speeds up queries.  
- **Intuitive Analysis**: Business users can conceptualize data more easily in dimensions and measures.  
- **OLAP Compatibility**: Designed for quick slicing, dicing, drilling, and pivoting.
