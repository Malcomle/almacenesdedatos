# OLAP Operations

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems allow users to interactively analyze multidimensional data. Common operations such as roll-up, drill-down, slice, dice, and pivoting provide flexible and powerful data exploration capabilities.

## Roll-Up and Drill-Down

- **Roll-Up**: Aggregates data to a higher-level summary. For instance, daily sales can be rolled up to monthly or quarterly totals.  
- **Drill-Down**: Moves from higher-level summaries to more detailed data. For example, monthly sales can be broken down to daily or hourly transactions.

## Slice and Dice

- **Slice**: Extracts a single dimension of the cube for a specific value or range (e.g., sales in 2023).  
- **Dice**: Applies filters across multiple dimensions at once (e.g., sales of electronics in Europe during Q1).

---

## Pivoting

- **Definition**: Reorients the data cube by rotating or swapping rows and columns, making it easier to view data from different perspectives.

## Benefits of OLAP Operations
- **Speed of Analysis**: Pre-aggregated cubes enable fast responses to complex queries.  
- **Flexible Exploration**: Users can quickly navigate from high-level overviews to granular details.  
- **Better Insights**: Multi-dimensional views allow unique business insights that arenâ€™t easily found in flat data structures.
